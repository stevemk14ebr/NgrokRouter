# NgrokRouter
Displays open ngrok tunnels in json. Ngrok assigns random urls to tunnels. On the lowest paid tier you are allowed to make two statically named domains. I suggest using on of the subdomains to run this application so that you can view which random urls get assigned to which tunnel.

# Usage
   npm run build
   npm run serve
   
# Dev
   npm run start
